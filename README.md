# Apnea
Studying and analyzing CPAP and other apnea data from OSCAR application 

The objective here is to provide tools to read OSCAR data to be used in machine learning tools.

## Requirements

## Data

Testing data (in data/) is one nap I took (about 15 minutes). Not all events are present in this file (no apnea event for example)

## Advancement
At the moment, this is a first Proof of concept to read session files (.001 files).
